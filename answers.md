Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?

The basic expected value formula is the probability of an event multiplied by the amount of times the event happens:
(P(x) * n).

The difference is that the expected value formula takes the probability of an event (and then uses it to calculate)

While mean is the sum of all events divided by the number of events

x = sum(x) / n


Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?
- statistical significance is highly affected by the size of the population
- overlooking an effect or outcome (A causes B) because of the lack of statistical significance - “Non significance doesn’t mean no effect”
- random variation can lead to large disparities in P values - “For example, even if researchers could conduct two perfect replication studies of some genuine effect, each with 80% power (chance) of achieving P < 0.05, it would not be very surprising for one to obtain P < 0.01 and the other P > 0.30. Whether a P value is small or large, caution is warranted“
- Statistical significance might not say much about a particular event (within a wider study) thus, it can lead researches to overlook the effect of/result of this particular event
- Significant tests provide no information about whether or not the result of an experiment is replicable http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bpsr/v7n1/02.pdf
